# CircularMenu
A Circual Menu for Android


##About CircularMenu
A few weeks ago, I've seen similar implementations in github.Yep,most of the implementation through extension ViewGroup | FrameLayout.
Moreover, those solutions are not suitable for my needs.So I try a different way to achieve.

####Just painting everything
In this sample,the custom view was just extends View(Not Viewgroup&FrameLayout)
####Attention
<li>Shown in the example is only one of many cases.At the same time, this example provide an idea that you can solve similar problems.

<li>Click event in home page just to do some demonstrations(to improve this in next step).

####Renderings
